# Kubernetes Authentication

Authentication for Kubernetes can be a bit of complex subject. If you're reading this for the first time; you'll need to get familiar with [how authentication works in k8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#users-in-kubernetes) before proceeding.

In short; k8s doesn't have a concept of "traditional users and groups" (excluding `serviceAccounts` of course), and relies on "external" authenticaion to provide "users/groups".

Some of the common methods of authentication are `X509 Client Certs`, `Static Password File`, and `OpenID Connect Tokens`. Usually people go with OIDC since it's the most flexable. 

There are many tools that are OIDC compliant; and can "front end" authentication to "back end" systems. The most popular ones are [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex#dex---a-federated-openid-connect-provider) and [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak#keycloak). These OIDC can front end (and also federate) things like LDAP, Active Directory, Google Auth, and Github (to name a few)

In this howto we will set up Dex to broker the authentication for k8s and GitHub (you can easily modify it to use anything else). This assumes that you have installed kubernetes with [kops](k8s-kops.md#kubernetes-with-kops) and are using TLS with [let's encrypt](k8s-ingress-helm.md#tls). Most of the installs are done with [helm](../../README.md#helm) as well. I have "templates" for files I used [here](../examples)

I'll try and make it as generic as possible; but if you're reading this, I'm assuming you know your way around k8s already.

## Prerequisites

First you have to create a new `Authorized oAuth App`  by going to your Organization's settings page. Fill it out with your server information. Here's an example...

![githuboauth](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4KAGf71GTJzEt_RExdPo4Q.png)

I used the above as an example and had these for my values

* Homepage URL: `https://dex.apps.k8s.example.com`
* Auth Callback: `https://dex.apps.k8s.example.com/callback`

Save the `Client ID` and `Client secret` generated by GitHub somewhere. You'll need these later
